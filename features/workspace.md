# Workspace

Workspaces are used to organise objects such as clusters, environments, test suites and test scenarios. They can be personal or units of collaboration (for example, a team workspace).&#x20;

## Create a New Workspace

If you are creating your first workspace, use the **Create New Workspace** button when you land inside the Testing application.

Give your workspace an appropriate **name.** For example, **** your team name if you plan to collaborate with others.&#x20;

Within your organisation, it's possible to **create multiple workspaces**.&#x20;

To do this, select the active workspace from the left-side navigation menu. Use the **Create New Workspace** button to create additional workspaces.

From within the Workspace Settings, you have the option to:

* Delete your workspace (careful, this action cannot be undone!)
