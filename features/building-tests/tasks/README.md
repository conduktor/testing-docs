# Tasks

Tasks are the building blocks that make up a [Test Scenario](../test-scenarios.md). Each task represents an action, for example:

* Producing to Kafka
* Consuming from Kafka

It's possible to create a scenario consisting of a single task, or many tasks that are chained together using the [Task Ports](task-ports.md).

In the diagram below, the scenario has **2 tasks** configured**.**&#x20;
