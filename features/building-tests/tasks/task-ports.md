# Task Ports

When you add a task to a scenario, you will notice there are **ports** which can be used for **chaining** tasks together. Depending on the task, you will have different ports available.

The ports act as event triggers that behave in different ways.&#x20;

| Task Type           | Port          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Producer / Consumer | `END`         | <p>Chained tasks will be triggered <strong>once,</strong> when the entire task <strong></strong> has <strong>finished executing</strong>.<br><br>For example, tasks chained to the <code>END</code> port of a <a href="producer-task.md">Producer</a> that's producing 10 messages will only be executed once (when all 10 messages have been produced). </p> |
| Producer / Consumer | `ON RECORD`   | <p>Chained tasks will be executed <strong>for each record</strong> that's either produced or consumed. <br><br>For example, a task chained to the <code>ON RECORD</code> port of a <a href="consumer-task.md">Consumer</a> that's consuming 10 messages will be executed 10 times (for each record).</p>                                                      |
| HTTP                | `ON RESPONSE` | Chained tasks will be executed after the HTTP response has been received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Variables           | `VARIABLES`   | Chained tasks will be executed after the variable condition has been set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
