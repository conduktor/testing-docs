# Test Suites

Test Suites represent a collection of test scenarios that are logically grouped together. We recommend organising your test suites by feature, service, or a specific domain.

## Create a Test Suite

From your Workspace, navigate to to the **Test Suite** tab in the main navigation.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Select **Create New**, you will then be prompted to provide a name.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

Now that your test suite is created, you can start creating [test scenarios](test-scenarios.md).
