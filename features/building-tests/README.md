# Building Tests

Tests are used to validate that your applications that integrate Apache Kafka are working as expected.&#x20;

Below outlines the basic terminology and entities that relate to test scenarios.

### Test Suite

* Suites represent a collection of test scenarios that are logically grouped together. We recommend organising your test suites by feature, service, or a specific domain.
* See [Test Suites](test-suites.md) for more information.

### Test Scenario

* Scenarios represent a graph of tasks used to validate some functionality in your application, pipeline or service.
* See [Test Scenarios](test-scenarios.md) for more information.

### Task

* Tasks are the building blocks that make up a test scenario. One task may represent producing data to Kafka, and another task may represent consuming from Kafka.&#x20;
* See [Tasks](tasks/) for more information.

### Test Check

* Boolean expressions used to validate a statement about the target under test. They execute against some data and return either a pass/fail result.&#x20;
* See [Test Checks](test-checks/) for more information.
